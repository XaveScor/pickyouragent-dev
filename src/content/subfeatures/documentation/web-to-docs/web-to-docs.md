Turn any website into agent-ready documentation.

This feature allows you to convert external websites and documentation into a format that agents can understand and use. Instead of manually copying and pasting documentation, you can provide a URL and the agent will process the web content to extract relevant information for context.

**Supported agents:**

- Cursor https://cursor.com/docs/context/mentions#adding-your-own-documentation

**Not supported agents:**

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Kilo Code
