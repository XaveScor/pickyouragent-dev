Sometimes agents create zombie or stuck processes while running a pipeline. If these are not cleaned up, they can use resources and interfere with later runs. This feature helps you find and manage such processes created by this pipeline, rather than showing all system processes.

Features:

- Shows all processes started by the pipeline
- Lets you check the status of each process
- Allows you to end or kill stuck/zombie processes
- Displays resource usage for these processes
- Helps you identify and stop anything the agent leaves running

**Not supported agents:**

- Kilo Code
- Cursor
