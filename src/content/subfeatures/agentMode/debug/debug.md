Diagnose, Trace, and Defeat Bugs with Precision.

Debug mode helps you find and fix problems in your code. The agent looks for bugs, errors, and issues by analyzing your code, checking error messages, and following how your program runs. Use debug mode when something isn’t working or you want to understand a problem.

**Supported agents:**

- Cursor (Use Shift+Tab to switch to debug mode)
- Kilo Code (Debug Mode is available in mode selector - type `/debug` or use mode selector)

**Not supported agents:**

- Claude Code (Has `--debug` flag but it's for debugging Claude Code itself, not a mode for debugging user code)
- Codex (No dedicated debug mode - can help with debugging tasks but no specific mode feature)
- Junie (No dedicated debug mode)
